# node-websockify (inspired by [@maximegris/node-websockify](https://github.com/maximegris/node-websockify))
WebSocket-to-TCP proxy/bridge in NodeJS

If you want to run a websockets to tcp proxy alongside a standard http server, this package is for you.

It is very similar to the aformentioned [@maximegris/node-websockify](https://github.com/maximegris/node-websockify), but the big difference is that library spins up a standalone web server. If you are already using a http server, you would be out of luck. This package lets you do that!
